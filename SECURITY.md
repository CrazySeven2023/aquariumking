B. California (CCPA/CPRA) — Your rights & how to exercise them

California residents have the following rights under the CCPA/CPRA, whether or not we actually sell/share your data. 

1.	Right to know (collection, use, disclosure) — You can request that we disclose: the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collected about you; the sources; the business/commercial purposes; and the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed it.
   
2.	Right to know whether we “sold” or “shared” your personal information — You can request that we tell you whether we sold or shared your personal information in the preceding 12 months, and if so, we will provide two separate lists:
   
o	the categories of personal information sold or shared and the categories of third parties to whom it was sold/shared; and

o	the categories of personal information disclosed for a business purpose.

If we have not sold or shared personal information in the preceding 12 months, we will state that. 

3.	Right to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information — You can direct us at any time to stop selling or sharing your personal information. We provide a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link and process user-enabled opt-out preference signals (e.g., Global Privacy Control) as valid requests. Once you opt out, we will not sell or share your personal information unless you later authorize us to do so.
   
4.	Right to delete, correct, and to limit the use/disclosure of sensitive personal information (where applicable), and non-discrimination for exercising rights.
   
5.	Authorized agents & verification — You may use an authorized agent to make requests; we may require proof of authorization and reasonable verification steps. We respond within 45 days (and may extend once for 45 more days with notice).

Disclosures for the preceding 12 months (CPRA look-back)

You can opt out at any time via [privacy-choices link] or by enabling GPC. 

Required links & notices

We maintain a clear and conspicuous “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on our internet homepages (and in-app settings) that either immediately effectuates your opt-out or takes you to the notice page where you can make that choice, consistent with CPPA regulations. 

C. Virginia (VCDPA)

Virginia residents may access, correct, delete, port, and opt out of targeted advertising, sale, and profiling with legal or similarly significant effects.
